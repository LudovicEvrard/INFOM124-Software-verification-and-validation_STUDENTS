The `concatenate` method concatenates a sequence of arrays. The return array consists of the entries of the input arrays concatenated in the order they appear in the argument list. Null arrays cause NullPointerExceptions; zero length arrays are allowed (contributing nothing to the output array).

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method.
